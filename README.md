# Sweeter theme for Xcode
A classier Xcode theme for classy Swift writers.

# FACT:
A good looking theme is directly correlated with writing good code - this is a proven factual gut feeling.

## License Restrictions
1. Only for classy engineers writing SwiftIU - Do not waste this on Objective-C you nerd!).

2. Must have a natural affinity for good design and sweet looking code otherwise I don't want to see this theme on your Xcode.

3. Must only be used on a Retina display Macbook or 4K+ external monitor. Anything less and you are infringing on this license, I will sue. The colors will only pop on a great display. Anything less and you are hurting the marketability of this theme which is an infringement.

4. As the author, I'm the only one with the legal right to break rule 3., I can't afford a 4K external monitor ATM.

5. Share & Enjoy!
